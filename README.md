## Project Type
**Decentralized AI Provenance and Verification Platform**

## Core Lane
**Further and Faster** — the AI lane, focused on agentic systems, inference marketplaces, verifiable pipelines, and retrieval tools.

## Overview
**AIVault** is a decentralized platform that brings **trust, transparency, and authenticity** to AI-generated data.

In a world where AI content can be easily faked or manipulated, AIVault ensures that **every AI output can be cryptographically verified** on the blockchain. It allows anyone — from developers to enterprises — to prove that a piece of data was **generated by a specific AI model, at a specific time, without tampering.**

## Problem Statement
AI systems are increasingly used to generate text, images, and data — but critical trust issues remain:

### Key Challenges:
- **Provenance**: How can we prove an AI actually created a specific output?
- **Integrity**: How do we know if an AI's output has been altered?
- **Trust**: How can we trust AI pipelines in enterprise or regulatory contexts?

### Vulnerabilities Without Verification:
- Deepfakes and synthetic media manipulation
- Disinformation campaigns
- Data manipulation and tampering
- Lost trust in automated systems
- Legal and compliance risks

## Solution
AIVault solves these challenges with a **blockchain-based verification and provenance layer** for AI workflows, creating an immutable trust layer for AI-generated content.

## How It Works

### 1. AI Task Submission
```
User Request -> Input Hashing (SHA-256) -> Task Queue
```
- User submits request (e.g., "Generate a summary" or "Write a report")
- Input data is cryptographically hashed using SHA-256
- Request metadata is recorded

### 2. AI Processing & Trace Generation
```
AI Model Processing -> Output Generation -> Trace Recording
```
- AI agent performs the requested task
- Model ID, parameters, and execution details captured
- Output and reasoning traces are hashed
- Comprehensive audit trail created

### 3. On-Chain Recording
```
Smart Contract -> Blockchain Storage -> Transaction Confirmation
```
- Input hash, output hash, model info, and timestamp stored on-chain
- Immutable record created via smart contract
- Transaction hash returned as proof

### 4. Verification & Validation
```
Verification Request -> Hash Comparison -> Trust Score
```
- Anyone can verify AI output against original hash
- Byte-level integrity checking
- Real-time verification results
- Trust scoring based on verification history

## Use Cases

## Architecture

```
User Request -> AI Agent -> AIVault API -> Smart Contract -> Blockchain Storage
                                      -> IPFS/Arweave
                                      -> Verification Interface -> Trust Verification
```

### Core Data Structure
Each AI output is cryptographically tied to:
- Input Hash - SHA-256 of input data
- Output Hash - SHA-256 of AI-generated content
- Model ID - Specific AI model identifier
- Timestamp - Precise generation time
- Owner - Wallet address of requester
- Metadata - Execution parameters and context
